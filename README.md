# agent-project-memory

`agent-project-memory` is a local-first CLI/devtool for generating evidence-backed project memory for Java/Spring codebases.

The goal is to help developers and AI coding agents understand a legacy Java/Spring project before changing it. The tool will scan local source code and project materials, extract deterministic facts, attach evidence references, and write Markdown/JSON artifacts that can be reviewed, versioned, and reused.

The current product focus is intentionally narrow:

- Java/Spring codebases first.
- Local repository analysis first.
- Maven projects first.
- Deterministic source analysis as the source of truth.
- Optional AI assistance later, outside the core analyzer.

The first version is intended to be a local-first CLI. Source code must not be sent to external services by default.

## Intended Usage

Future command:

```sh
agent-project-memory scan .
```

Intended output:

```text
.project-memory/project-map.json
.project-memory/evidence-index.jsonl
.project-memory/endpoints.md
.project-memory/agent-guide.md
```

These files are meant to give humans and coding agents a compact, evidence-backed map of the project: detected build layout, Spring MVC endpoints, important components, and references back to the source files that prove each fact.

## What This Is Not

`agent-project-memory` is not:

- a generic AI documentation generator,
- a repository chatbot,
- a RAG system,
- a SaaS product,
- a DeepWiki clone,
- a tool that treats LLM output as the source of truth,
- an automatic code modification system.

AI may become an optional presentation or summarization layer later, but the core project memory must come from deterministic analysis, explicit output contracts, and evidence references.

## Project Status

Implementation has not started yet.

This repository currently contains the initial product, architecture, and development documentation needed before production code is added.
